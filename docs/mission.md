# Mission Overview

The Interplanix Space Situational Awareness (SSA) project aims to deliver a modern, open, and extensible platform for tracking, analyzing, and responding to the growing number of objects in Earth's orbit.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor satellites, space debris, and other orbital bodies.
- Provide real-time visualizations and analytics.
- Support international collaboration on orbital safety.
- Integrate AI/ML models for collision prediction and threat assessment.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

As Earth’s orbital environment becomes increasingly congested and contested, there is a critical need for advanced tools that provide transparency, early warning, and decision-making support.

Interplanix SSA is our step toward ensuring orbital safety for both public and private stakeholders in space.
