# System Architecture

The Interplanix SSA system is modular and designed for scalability and extensibility.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Sources: TLE (Two-Line Element Sets), sensor feeds, satellite databases.
- Parsing and normalization pipelines.

### 2. Data Processing & Modeling
- Orbit propagation using SGP4 or higher-fidelity models.
- AI/ML models for anomaly detection and collision prediction.

### 3. Visualization Layer
- Interactive 2D/3D dashboards.
- Time-based orbital trajectory animations.
- Global alert map.

### 4. Backend Services
- RESTful APIs and data access endpoints.
- Event logging, alerting, and user authentication.

## 🛠 Technologies (Planned or Under Evaluation)

- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, React, CesiumJS, Three.js
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, Docker, PostgreSQL with PostGIS

## 🔁 Workflow
