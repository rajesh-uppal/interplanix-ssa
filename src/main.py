# This script serves as the starting file to validate environment setup and project structure.
# Future functionality for data ingestion, processing, modeling, and visualization will build on this foundation.

# Define the main function that acts as the program's entry point.

    # Print a welcome message to verify that the script is working.

# This conditional ensures that the main() function is executed 
# only when this script is run directly, and not when imported as a module.
